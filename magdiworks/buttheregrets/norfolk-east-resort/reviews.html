        <h4> Since its foundation, Norfolk East Resort has proudly been the golden standard of English holiday resorts. </h4>
        <p> From critics' choice to customer's favourite, our holiday resort satisfies plenty of people - and for good
    reason. </p>

    <h2> Professional reviews </h2>
    <div class="review"> <p> "Simply put, the best holiday resort in the entire East of England. It's just
    amazing how everything smoothly works together." </p> <h4> - TripAdvisor</h4> </div>
    <div class="review"> <p> "Norfolk East Resort is the gold
    standard. The quality of everything is unbelieveable. Service is quite simply the greatest
    we've ever experienced. Quite possibly the best British hotel there is, and that's a statement
    we're not taking lightly." </p> <h4> - Oyster.co.uk</h4> </div>
    <div class="review"><p> "In terms of activities, it has it all. It's quite possibly the most
    diverse hotel resort. If you can withstand the weather, you're looking at one hell of a
    holiday experience - Great Yarmouth finally has an attraction it can be truly proud of."
    </p><h4> - Eastern Daily Press </h4></div>
    <div class="review"><p> "It's so stress-free and relaxing, I've had so many fun memories. It's a hefty
        fee, sure, but you're getting your money's worth on an experience that you will quite possibly
        never forget. Incredible all the way through."
    </p><h4> - The Telegraph </h4></div>
    <div class="review"><p> "The hotel just <b> breathes </b> quality - it's detail to the fullest. Nothing
        can really come quite close to the perfectionist attitudes the professionals at Norfolk East Resort
        can achieve. It's certainly a contender for the best hotel in England."
