        <h2> Our History </h2>
        <h4> Norfolk East Resort was made to be more than just a holiday resort. </h4>
        <p> Great Yarmouth had, traditionally, been lacking in such grand hotel resorts.
        After years of complaints, troubles, and poor services in the area, it was time for someone
        to come up and offer a richer holiday resort experience. After an initial budget, permission to build the resort started in 2015, and finished
        in November 2016. Since then, it's taken Norfolk by storm as one of the most premium and
        top of its class - a feat that very little can admire. </p>
